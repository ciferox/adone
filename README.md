  <h1>ADONE</h1>
  <p><i>The JavaScript generalized core for building Cyber Fractal Systems Infrastructure (CFSI)</i></p>
</div>

**ADONE** embodies most of the Agile and DevOps ideas, and can be used in all cycles of developing Node.js-projects and not only (design, development, testing, automation, balancing, monitoring, maintenance, etc.).

## Features

- Latest features of JavaScript (ES2015, ES2016, ES2017).
- High quality code as the result of automated testing and a strict coding standard (which assumes that the developer must understand what he is doing).
- Maximum performance and lack of code redundancy due to lack of npm-dependencies and built-in lazify-mechanism.
- High stability and fault tolerance due to the use of its own executive ecosystem.
- Adaptability expressed through the ability to scale and ease maintenance.
- Strict system hierarchy and the existence of self-similarity at all levels, implemented through the use of a single code base, the same paradigms and same architectural principles.
- Multipurpose use (WEB, IoT, Rototics, Automation, ...).
